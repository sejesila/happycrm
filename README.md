## Workflows
 - A user signs up or signs in with their email and password, and is presented with a basic dashboard showing their current appointments, and some basic stats about their business from the CRM
 - They select to view all appointments, which takes them to a table that shows upcoming or previous appointments, and the customer associated with them. The user views an appointment to get more details or edit the information for it.
 - A user selects to view all messages,which operates much like the appointment section
 - A user selects to view all customers,which shows them a table of every person who has requested an appointment or sent a message. The user views a single customer,which shows their information(phone number,email,name,etc) as well as any appointments or messages that particular person has sent, and they can modify any information about this customer
 - A user navigate to the settings area, where they can view and edit basic information about their account
 - A customer is sent or navigates to the appointment request form, which they fill out with some basic information including what service from the user they need. They click submit and the form information is sent to the CRM and a new appointment is made associated with this customer
 - A customer is sent or navigates to the contact request form,which operates in the same way as appointments but with less detail,and it goes into the messages section of the CRM
